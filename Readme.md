Sorry for the delay. I had a few things to take care of before starting in on this.

You decide your own involvement. Write some code. Put in some issues. Fork some branches. Start your own project. Whatever you want. Communicate however you'd like. My phone currently only dings for emails, twitter mentions, phone calls, and text messages. If your communication isn't in one of those forms I may see it at some point. I should have a cryptographically secure communications network running soon. If you have another preference (including no communication at all), let me know.

English is a pretty ambiguous language, so I will try to minimize it's use for now. This is about code. Specifically, code from the ECMAScript 2015, HTML, CSS/LESS, and Bash languages at the moment.

I'm still working on the overall architecture for the site (again, you set your own involvement here), but for now I'm going to work on getting a prototype interface up as quickly as possible to start laying down some thoughts I've had. A mock interface can be live in...hours? That's what I'll be aiming for anyway. It should create some good discussion points (or fail [or...]) anyway.

I'm going to figure out how to pull my base-angular project into this repository. From there, a pretty decently wired up Angular base project will exist and I (we?) can rapidly scaffold out any idea that we can fit into a web page. If you want/need some help with getting the code running, let me know and I can write some better docs, tutorial, 1-on-1, whatever.

I'm going to rename the readme from the base project to: scaffolding.md

It should get you started.


Off to work now.
