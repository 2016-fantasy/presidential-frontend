## No Fancy Stuff

I made this phrase the description of the GitHub repo so that I will not forget a particular thought I had.

Let's try to avoid getting bogged down in too much architectural aeronautics. Let's figure out what we want/need, find the most direct path to get there, and then start walking down it. If it's not on the path, we don't touch it. Maybe make a note or take a picture of something interesting, but don't get off the path until we make it to the destination.

I think the only way that makes sense to build this is to assume that millions of people may be using it simultaneously. I don't believe it's worth building if that is not the scale we are building towards.

I also think we should be pushing towards user-visible features as quickly as possible. We should find something that works and then scale it as fast as we can, technically and socially. I believe there is a good chance that there is a widely compelling application here that could explode if we can find it and instantiate it. The key here will be presenting an entirely coherent view to the user that will make it obvious what is going on (we still need to figure this out, as well) and will be so compelling that few will be able to resist.

~~The real key is figuring out your data model in the most abstract sense. If we know what we want to model, the only exercise left is transforming what we currently have into the model we want. Easy. So let's focus on getting the right data model.~~ [Note: this paragraph doesn't really fit here anymore, but I don't want to delete it.]

Having said all that, I like "fancy" stuff. That is, what might appear fancy, but is actually even simpler, once you're able to look through your current understanding and learn something better. So, I think we should try and consider any idea, however, we should only actually do the simplest, most straightforward ones.
