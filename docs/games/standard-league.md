#League Creation

1. Select candidates by moving them from pasture into stable.
2. Choose the type of events the league will use to judge the candidates.
3. (Advanced) Select particular sub-streams of event types.
4. Choose draft type (real-time vs. "mail-in"). Set draft date/time.
5. Drop into game.


#Achievements

Humorous messages delivered straight to eyeballs. The more user-customizable the achievement engine is, the better [although we may want to provide reasonable defaults].


#League Achievements

Each league (or someone appointed by the league [ie. league-master, admin, or any other adjective you want]) may establish criteria by which players may be awarded points or special achievement awards. This will provide an opportunity for humor.

Example: If a player drafts only candidates from a single party, they are awarded the Partisan Hack achievement.


#Global Achievements

Example: When creating a league, adding any candidate to your stable earns you the Donor Achievement. Adding most of the Republican party earns you the Koch Achievement. Et cetra.


#Activities / Games

## Talking Points

Members are awarded points for how many times one of their racers says specific words (defined somewhere) during an event or collection of events.
